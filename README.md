# Patchbay-scry

Scrying is the practice of looking into a suitable medium in the hope of detecting significant messages or visions. The objective might be personal guidance, prophecy, revelation, or inspiration, but down the ages, scrying in various forms also has been a prominent means of divination or fortune-telling. It remains popular in occult circles, discussed in many websites, and books; both modern and centuries old.

This is a plugin for Patchbay which uses [scuttle-poll](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttle-poll) (an implementation of Loomio's voting system) to build an app for finding meeting times:

Once you've found a times, this offers the ability to great a gathering (see [patchbay-gatherings](https://github.com/ssbc/patchbay-gatherings)) to create a calendar event:
